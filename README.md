# DNA CRYPTOGRAPHY

DNA computing based encryption and decryption algorithm. 


## INTRODUCTION
Secure communication is vital to facilitate confidential exchange of information between sender and reciever.
Nowadays, internet has become the media for all banking and electronic commerce transactions and it is very essential that the transaction is made in a very secure manner. In order to secure these transactions, mathematical encoding and decoding algorithm are used to encrypt plain text. DNA cryptography is one of the technique which can be used to encrypt and decrypt transactions.

DNA cryptography uses Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (CDMB) concept for encryption and decryption.

**CDMB** - A theory that describes the flow of information from DNA to RNA to protien.
